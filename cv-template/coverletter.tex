%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}
I am interested and excited to see your listing for the Embedded Software \& Hearing Performance Developer position.
It is my hope that you will see through this application that I have applicable experience in a variety of fields that I believe can be combined and developed further with your company.
I also firmly believe that Sonova could be the best place for me to grow as a learner and excel as a developer.

\lettersection{About Me}
Graduating from Mechatronic Systems Engineering at Western University, I have developed technical skills from across the disciplines of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.
Having also gained 24 months of internship experience in automotive R\&D and manufacturing, I discovered that I wanted to change my career path but was unsure of which path to take next.
Through school and work, I refined skills in hardware and software development including the design of analog and digital electronics and filters.
Luckily, I have been able to spend the year following my graduation exploring and developing personal and career skills with newfound freedom.

As an educator, I have been able to independently relearn the process of learning itself from a new perspective and integrate pedagogical strategies into my instructional design.
In particular, my role as a teacher of Science, Mathematics, and Technology at Robarts School for the Deaf presented the challenging and fascinating nuance of information accessibility using Bilingual-Bicultural instruction.
Although this area of study was completely new to me when I started teaching my own classes of Deaf students, I took the challenge in stride and adapted to student needs and Deaf culture, teaching STEM concepts and vocabulary in both ASL and English.

As an operations manager, I was able to learn the art of excellent customer service, sales, and team leadership.
I have developed a foundation of empathy, clear communication, and patience, upon which I have built strong customer relationships by offering honest insight to connect customers with products and services that suit their particular needs.

\lettersection{Why Sonova?}
It is my belief that Sonova would be an enriching environment in which to combine my technical and non-technical skill sets to pursue my dream of leveraging software to ensure accessibility for all people.
Having worked directly with schools such as W. Ross Macdonald School for the Blind in Brantford, ON, and Robarts School for the Deaf in London, ON, I seek to create sense and enable a life without limitations for persons with sensory needs; particularly those who are d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing.

Helping others to indpendently and confidently navigate their lives and the world through providing inclusive solutions is what has motivated me most in my work to date.
I believe that my passion for designing for accessibility coincides closely with the goals of Sonova, and so it would be my dream to work with your team to build the future of hearing the world.

Outside of my work experience, I am also very interested in audio production and the design of analog and digital audio plugins. I am very familiar with sampling, filter design, Fourier transformations, spectal analysis, and compression.
It would be of great interest to me to continue to learn in these areas as it pertains to my passion for accessibility.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
In every venture I undertake, I give my absolute effort to learn as much as possible to excel and help my team to succeed.
Through a systems design approach and excellent interpersonal and communication skills, I have been able to lead engineering teams in embedded software development to produce interdisciplinary solutions that are inclusive of all.
I take pride in my work and I know that I will take full advantage of the opportunity to contribute to Sonova's meaningful mission to help people enjoy the delight of hearing.

My multidisciplinary background across the fields of engineering, Deaf education, and customer service position me well to understand multiple aspects of Sonova's products and services, providing me with a bigger picture from which to apply my skills.

I would love to meet to discuss the value that I could add as an Embedded Software \& Hearing Performance Developer at Sonova and am available at your earliest convenience to discuss my qualifications in more detail.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
