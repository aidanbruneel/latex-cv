%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}
I am interested and excited to see your listing for the Associate Software Developer position at Uvaro.
It is my hope that you will see through this application package that I have applicable experience in a variety of fields that I believe can be combined and developed further with your company.
I also firmly believe that Uvaro could be the best place for me to grow as a learner and excel as a developer.

% y do I have management experience in sales and experience as a teacher and a teacher of the Deaf, but also, as a dynamic Mechatronics Systems Engineer with a strong background and interest in coding and software engineering that delivers clean, high performance code, I am confident that I would be an asset to your team.

\lettersection{About Me}
Graduating from Mechatronic Systems Engineering at Western University, I have developed technical skills from across the disciplines of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.
Having also gained 24 months of internship experience in the automotive industry, I discovered that I wanted to change my career path but was unsure of which path to take next.
Luckily, I have been able to spend the year following my graduation exploring and developing important personal and career skills with newfound freedom.

As an educator, I have been able to independently relearn the process of learning itself from a new perspective and integrate pedagogical strategies into my instructional design.
In particular, my role as a teacher of Science, Mathematics, and Technology at Robarts School for the Deaf presented the challenging and fascinating nuance of information accessibility using Bilingual-Bicultural instruction.
Although this area of study was completely new to me when I started teaching my own classes of students, I took the challenge in stride and adapted to student needs.

As an operations manager, I was able to learn the art of excellent customer service, sales, and team leadership.
I have developed a foundation of empathy, clear communication, and patience, upon which I have built strong customer relationships by offering honest insight to connect customers with products and services that suit their particular needs.


% Integrating multiple domains and engineering systems to develop creative, optimized, high quality and secure solutions is my passion, and I love to learn and collaborate with others in my work. I have a solid background in Computer Science including data structures, algorithms, databases and distributed systems. I am an experienced author of C++ and Python, and many other computer languages, tools, applications, frameworks, and libraries. Continuing to grow my skills in software engineering while also leveraging the multidisciplinary aspect of my mechatronics engineering expertise drives my intended career. Also, I am looking to relocate to Kitchener. Providing software solutions to transform the way the world learns is ultimately how I want to contribute professionally to the world. In teaching for school boards and at Robarts School for the Deaf, I use software tools to create online environments for their learning. My engineering capstone project involved working with the school for the blind to develop a device to support orientation and mobility for their students.


\lettersection{Why Uvaro?}
It is my belief that Uvaro would be an enriching environment in which to combine my technical and non-technical skill sets to pursue my dream of leveraging software to ensure accessibility for all students.
Having worked directly with schools such as W. Ross Macdonald School for the Blind in Brantford, ON, and Robarts School for the Deaf in London, ON, I seek to understand the impediments to learning and agency in students with sensory needs.
I believe that my passion for designing for accessibile learning coincides closely with the goals of Uvaro, and so it would be my dream to work with your team to build compelling learning solutions that are inclusive.

% Accessibility and education are areas of great interest to me. My passion for creating software solutions that support all learners and teachers is aligned with D2L’s search for software developers who help you to advance the goal of using technology to transform teaching and learning around the world. When teaching, I experienced first-hand the current integration of technology in educating and learning and my vision aligns with yours. Integration of both software and hardware is the future of learning platforms (i.e., virtual reality) and my mechatronics and software background directly supports such work. My experience gives me insight into mainstream teacher and student needs for the software that D2L creates, as of end users who are Deaf, blind, or Deafblind. I believe understanding these functionality and accessibility needs is critical to the ongoing evolution of the D2L learning platform whether for K-12, post secondary, or company-based use. I am passionate about this work and D2L is a dream job for me. In it, I can leverage my skills, experiences, and understanding to make a difference for current and future learning. I am submitting multiple applications for similar software engineering jobs at D2L because, ultimately, D2L is where I see myself best contributing to a better world. I want to work for a company that values and supports staff well-being, and invests in maintaining a learning culture. D2L is clearly such a company and we even share a love of dogs. I know we are a great fit.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
% In addition to my technical skills, my specialized understanding of the diverse end users and their accessibility needs, position me to design and test software solutions that are inclusive of all end users and that best support their learning and teaching experience. I am confident that my excellent work ethic, the systems thinking and the design approach I take to construct solutions, my unparalleled attention to detail, and the great pride I take in authoring and testing clean, reliable, efficient, and well-designed code will contribute to the success of D2L, making me an immediate asset to the team. 

In every venture I undertake, I give my absolute effort to learn as much as possible to excel and help my team to succeed.
Through a systems design approach and focused attention to detail, I have been able to lead engineering teams in software development to produce innovative and interdisciplinary solutions that are inclusive of all.
I take pride in my work and I know that I will take full advantage of the opportunity to contribute to Uvaro's meaningful and forward-thinking mission to help in launching fulfilling careers in technology.

I would love to meet to discuss the value that I could add as an Associate Software Developer at Uvaro and am available at your earliest convenience to discuss my qualifications in more detail.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
